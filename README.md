# Webagotchi

Remember Tamagotchis? Well now they are back! Only updated for the modern age! Raise your new Web-agotchi in your browser, on your phone, on your tablet, wherever you are! Just be sure to make sure it's ready for your day! Your web pet will have needs based on the weather, so if it's going to rain, make sure you've given it an umbrella, or if it's going to be hot out make sure you've given it plenty of water! Will your webagotchi be your new best friend?

## Installation
To run a local version of Webagotchi, pull either the `main` branch, or you may pull any of the available `testing` branches to try out the latest features before they are released into the main branch. You can then start the built-in local server for Webagotchi using the following:

`npm start`

Your new virtual friend will be accesible at the link provided in the terminal.

## Configuration

By default, Webagotchi will try to start on port 5000. This can be changed by either passing the `--port` argument, or `-p`, followed by a port number, or by creating a `config.json`  file in the root folder of the project directory, with the "port" key.
